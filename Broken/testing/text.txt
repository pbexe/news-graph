Syria vote: Cameron and Corbyn clash over air strikes 2 December 2015 From the section UK Politics comments Media captionLive: MPs debate the arguments for and against bombing Syria ahead of a vote David Cameron has told MPs that bombing so-called Islamic State in Syria will "keep the British people safe".But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the PM's case "doesn't stack up" as MPs debate whether to back air strikes.Mr Cameron faced calls to apologise for saying opponents of military action were "terrorist sympathisers", with Mr Corbyn saying it "demeaned" his office.The PM declined to apologise, but said there was "honour" in voting for or against military action.The 10 hour Commons debate will end with a vote on whether the UK joins others such as France, the US and Russia in bombing targets in Syria. /**/ (function() { if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.adverts && bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync) { bbcdotcom.adverts.slotAsync('mpu', [1,2,3]); } })(); /**/ Live video and text updates ahead of the Syria debate and vote Key quotes and clips: At-a-glance Syria air strikes: What you need to know Are there 70,000 Syrian 'moderates' ready to back UK? Where the UK's parties stand on air strikes Air strikes could begin soon, if the Commons delivers what Mr Cameron hopes will be a majority after Mr Corbyn abandoned attempts to impose his opposition to military action on Labour and allowed his MPs a free vote.Mr Cameron called on MPs to "answer the call from our allies" and take action against the "woman-raping, Muslim-murdering, medieval monsters" of IS, who he warned were "plotting to kill us and to radicalise our children right now".He said MPs faced a simple question: "Do we work with our allies to degrade and destroy this threat and do we go after these terrorists in their heartlands from where they are plotting to kill British people, or do we sit back and wait for them to attack us?" Media captionDavid Cameron insisted he was "not ignoring the risks" of military action in Syria Media captionJeremy Corbyn emphasised the "potentially far-reaching consequences" of the government's vote on intervention in Syria The prime minister also defended his controversial claim that there were 70,000 moderate opposition fighters in Syria, saying it was the estimate of the Joint Intelligence Committee - the UK's senior intelligence body.He said the majority were members of the Free Syrian Army and that there were a further 20,000 Kurdish fighters with whom Britain could also work.He told MPs the forces were "not ideal, not as many as we would like, but they are people we can work with".Mr Cameron said that in future the UK government would be referring to IS as Daesh as much as possible, because "this evil death cult is neither a true representation of Islam nor is it a state".Daesh has negative connotations in the Middle East and is seen by some as a way of challenging the legitimacy of the group. Media captionSNP's Robertson: I hope the PM regrets what he said Media captionLiam Fox: Relying on allies is 'national embarrassment' Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: "It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the prime minister understands public opposition to his ill thought-out rush to war is growing - and wants to hold the vote before it slips from his hands. "Whether it's the lack of a strategy worth the name, the absence of credible ground troops, the missing diplomatic plan for a Syrian settlement, the failure to address the impact on the terrorist threat or the refugee crisis and civilian casualties."It's become increasingly clear that the prime minister's proposals for military action simply do not stack up."He disputed Mr Cameron's claim about ground troops, saying it was "quite clear there are no such forces" and only extremists would take advantage of the strikes against IS.Three former Labour ministers - Alan Johnson, Dame Margaret Beckett and Yvette Cooper - made speeches in favour of extending military action.Mr Johnson, a former home secretary, said he believed IS had to be "confronted and destroyed if we are to properly defend our country and our way of life".And he took a swipe at Jeremy Corbyn's supporters, saying: "I find this decision as difficult as anyone to make, I wish I had frankly the self-righteous certitude of the finger-jabbing representatives of our new and kinder type of politics, who will no doubt soon be contacting those of us who support this motion tonight."Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham told BBC News he would be voting against air strikes as he believed they would make an attack in the UK more likely but he added: "I wouldn't rule out taking military action at some point."Former Labour leader Ed Miliband will also vote against air strikes, telling the LabourList website they would not "defeat ISIL or make us safer here at home".A number of Conservative rebels spoke out against the prime minister's position.

"Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past, let's not give the green light to military action without a comprehensive and credible plan to win the peace."But Lib Dem leader Tim Farron warned against learning the wrong lessons from the "illegal, counterproductive war in Iraq", saying: "On balance it is right to take military action to degrade and defeat this evil death cult."Analysis Image copyright Reuters By BBC Security Correspondent Frank GardnerIndependent experts say the figure of 70,000 is broadly accurate but there is a high degree of scepticism as to how many could actually be persuaded to fight IS instead of the Syrian regime, let alone be moulded into a cohesive, effective force.There are also questions over just how "moderate" and pluralistic many of the Islamist factions are within this number. It is far from certain that, if empowered in a post-Assad, post-IS Syria, battle-hardened Sunni rebels would be happy to share power with Christians and Alawites.Read more from FrankJeremy Corbyn's aides say as many as 90 Labour MPs could vote to back the government motion - but at least 110 MPs from six different parties - including the SNP, which opposes action - have already signed up to an amendment seeking to block air strikes.According to BBC research, of the 640 MPs expected to vote, 362 MPs are in favour of the motion while 175 are against. Of the remainder, 19 are "leaning to" supporting the government, three are "leaning against" while 80 are undecided. A vote is expected at around 22:00 GMT.The prime minister caused controversy on the eve of the vote by labelling Mr Corbyn and other opponents of action as "terrorist sympathisers".Responding to SNP and Labour calls to apologise for the comments, Mr Cameron said: "Everyone in this House should make up their mind on the arguments in this House and there's honour in voting for, there's honour in voting against."That is the way this House should operate and that's why I wanted to be absolutely clear at the start of my statement that this is about how we fight terrorism not whether we fight terrorism." The government says military action is "only one component of a broader strategy" to tackle IS and the UK government would not deploy troops on the ground.The UK is already providing intelligence, surveillance and other logistical support to countries fighting IS in Syria. The RAF has also carried out thousands of raids on IS targets in Iraq since Parliament approved similar action there last year. Can British forces make a difference in Syria?

A presidential war of words Russia's food and foreign policy recipe Isis, Isil, IS or Daesh? "According to available information, the highest level of the political leadership of the country, President Erdogan and his family, are involved in this criminal business," Mr Antonov told journalists in Moscow."The Turkish leadership has demonstrated extreme cynicism. Look at what they are doing!" he said."They have invaded the territory of another country and are brazenly plundering it."War of words continues - Steve Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Image copyright Reuters Image caption Russian images purported to show the supply chain between Syria and Turkey The Russian defence ministry does not usually invite foreign journalists to its media briefings on Syria. But on Wednesday it made an exception. It had a message it wanted the whole world to hear: that the faces of Turkey's leaders, including President Erdogan, were "smeared with stolen oil".Invited journalists and military attaches were shown satellite images and grainy video footage, purporting to show tanker trucks with oil crossing from IS-held territory into Turkey. But, from what I could tell, no evidence was presented to implicate the Turkish president. He has accused Russia of slander.After the shooting down of the Russian bomber by Turkey last week, the war of words continues between Moscow and Ankara. Listening to the military officials at this briefing, you could hear the anger in their voices. Their strong language reflects their president's conviction that Turkey has "stabbed Russia in the back". The defence ministry cited satellite images that it said showed oil tankers travelling from IS-held territory to Turkey.The trucks, it said, travelled to three locations - including refineries - in Turkey and some was then moved on to a third country.Russia said it was producing only "part of the evidence" for now and did not provide direct proof of their claim that Mr Erdogan and family were involved. Responding to the Russian allegations, Mr Erdogan said "no one has a right to engage in slander against Turkey by saying that Turkey is buying oil from Daesh [IS]".He repeated a promise to resign if the claims were proven true, but added he did not want to see relations with Russia worsen further.US officials have previously said they have information suggesting Turkish "middlemen" were involved in the illegal IS oil trade. The Turkish authorities have made commitments to tackle smuggling on their territory. Media captionSyria crisis: Putin and Erdogan talk tough over downed jet. Despite the tensions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said he is prepared to meet Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu at a conference in the Serbian capital Belgrade this week.Mr Lavrov said he was willing to "hear what Mr Cavusoglu has to say", in comments broadcast on the Rossiya 24 news channel. It would be the first time the men have met since the downing of the jet.
